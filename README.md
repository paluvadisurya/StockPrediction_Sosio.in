### Libraries Used
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- MySQL
- Sci-Kit Learn

### Conclusion
#### 93% Accurate Linear Model Obtained
 - Total time tajen to run the files : 10 Seconds
- SQL Connector Library helped us to retrieve data from the servers easily
- Pandas library helped us alot by converting the data & storing the data in csv file
- The recieved data is not much jumbled and cleaning of data become a bit easy task for us, Thanks for the data collectors
- Successfully plotted all the companies stock price information using the pandas plotting tool/library
- Trained our model using Sci-Kit Linear Regression
- We have recieved very less time for executing the code & we can also use this model to display the data live in terms
- An accuracy of 93% for a linear model is a very good fit.
- SOme of the companies data is not rising and not falling apart.
- Refreshing the data / Loading the data will take only 10 Seconds of time.
